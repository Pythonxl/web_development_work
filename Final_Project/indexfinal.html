                built-up
                area of Turkey. As urbanization continue towards east, a larger metropolitan region with Tarsus and

            <p>Mersin is an important hub of Turkey's economy, and Turkey's largest seaport is located in the city.
                Mersin's
                nickname in Turkey is "Pearl of the Mediterranean" (Turkish: Akdeniz'in İncisi), and the city hosted the

            <h2 class="modern">Modern Mersin</h2>
            <p>Today, Mersin is a large city spreading out along the coast, with skyscrapers, huge hotels, an opera
                house, expensive real estate near the sea or up in the hills, and many other modern urban amenities. The
                seaside of Mersin is the longest seaside in Turkey as well as in Eastern Mediterranean. </p>
            <p>The Metropolitan Municipality is now trying to rescue the sea front with walkways, parks and statues, and
                there are still palm trees on the roadsides especially where the young generation like to hang out in
                the cafés and patisseries of smart neighbourhoods such as Pozcu or Çamlıbel.These are
                established neighbourhoods where there are many well-known shops and restaurants with years of
                experience and reputations to protect. The city centre is a maze of narrow streets and arcades of little
                shops and cafes, with young people buzzing around on scooters. The old quarter near the fish market is
                where you will find the stalls selling tantuni and grilled liver sandwiches. </p>
            <p> One of the most distinctive features of the city as a whole is the solar heating panels, they are
                everywhere, on top of every building.</p>
